## Glucose sensor project 
Contains schematics, firmware, tools to work with non-invasive PoC board.

For reading electrical schematics you need [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) and for mechanical schematics you need [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

#### Repositories
- [sensor-schematics](https://github.com/sugar-sensor/sensor-schematics) contains electrical and mechanical design schematics as well as production BOM and GERBER files for sensor manufacturing.
- [mbed-os-sensor-firmware](https://github.com/sugar-sensor/mbed-os-sensor-firmware) is firmware flashed into MCU to control sensor. This firware is designed for MAX32630FHTR. For wearable device TinyPICO was selected, but this MCU is not supported by MbedOS. From the other side MbedOS is deprecated and firmware must be rewritten anyway
- [max30002](https://github.com/sugar-sensor/max30002) BioZ chip driver for MbedOS
- [measurements-db](https://github.com/sugar-sensor/measurements-db) software to parse CSV files generated by sensor and saved to MAX32630FHTR SD-card. It creates SQLite3 database
